## Highlights

- **p. 14** — "Only connect! That was the whole of her sermon. Only connect the prose and the passion, and both will be exalted, and human love will be seen at its height."

- **p. 58** — "The poor cannot always reach those whom they want to love, and they can hardly ever escape from those whom they love no longer."

- **p. 72** — *[Note]* This connects to Williams on structures of feeling — the Schlegels embody a particular historical moment of liberal conscience.

- **p. 103** — "She felt that those who prepare for all the emergencies of life beforehand may equip themselves at the expense of joy."

- **p. 147** — "It is the vice of a vulgar mind to be thrilled by bigness."

- **p. 203** — "Personal relations are the important thing for ever and ever, and not this outer life of telegrams and anger."

- **p. 289** — "The businessman who assumes that this life is everything, and the mystic who asserts that it is nothing, fail, on this side and on that, to hit the truth."
